3	Palindrome Checker	string reversal	Handle phrases ignoring spaces
4	Simple Calculator	arithmetic ops, input handling	Add error messages for bad input
5	Fibonacci Generator	loops/recursion	Print first N Fibonacci numbers
6	Pattern Printer	nested loops	Print pyramid or diamond pattern
7	Factorial Finder	recursion vs iteration	Compare speed of both methods
🔁 Week 2 — Strings, Lists, and Dictionaries

Goal: Learn to manipulate data and structure logic clearly.

Day	Project	Focus	Bonus Challenge
8	Word Frequency Counter	dicts, file reading	Sort by highest frequency
9	Anagram Checker	sorting, strings	Handle multi-word anagrams
10	Password Strength Checker	regex or conditions	Suggest missing elements
